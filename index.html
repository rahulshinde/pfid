        the way i get to travel to my roots<br>
        fruitful from the motherland<br>
        rooted but afloat; out here we bloom<br>
        i remember<br>
        the pinch and peel of a mamón<br>
        the feel of the hard jelly yet citrus kiss<br>
        the gooey drop encased between my two fingers<br>
        then travelled into my mouth perfectly fitting in between my lips<br>
        i remember<br>
        mangos which i ate straight from the tree<br>
        they can never be replicated by the<br>
        grocery-store-bought-in-the-middle-of-winter “man-goes”<br>
        the juice dripping down my fingers, barely any fibers,<br>
        pit perfectly fit the size of my mouth,<br>
        perfectly hand held as a merienda when we were locked out of the house<br>
        i remember<br>
        guayabas<br>
        sometimes came wrapped in little plastic sweet like candy; dulces<br>
        empalagante to the palate<br>
        so pink and soft like my cheeks when i am flustered,<br>
        yet citric with little pits that excited my teeth and tastebuds at every little bite<br>
        i remember<br>
        nísperos the rough outside like dry skin on your elbows,<br>
        it cuts so softly and with a spoon i’d scoop out the insides, so sweet,<br>
        some one-or-two seeds, in between, i’d take them out they were so clean<br>
        and i loved it on any time of the day, i could eat so many,<br>
        a sweetness i only remembered once i felt it again<br>
        far away from the motherland<br>
        i vaguely remember<br>
        parchitas<br>
        juice, pulp, acid, crunchy,<br>
        bitter on the outside but on the inside, feisty,<br>
        the man at the mercado shook it like a maraca<br>
        guts travelled from edge to edge of its globular skin<br>
        announcing it was ready for consumption<br>
        but i could not remember how to eat it

        my womanhood is rebuilt in the setting sun<br>
        my vagina theoretical, womb swollen in my throat<br>
        birthing stories that claw their way through thin tissue.<br>
        <br>
        I spit blood with each poem,<br>
        I birth myself with each bite.<br>
        <br>
        *<br>
        <br>
        blood and berries, unconscious lust<br>
        for the sweet, the savage<br>
        stain my red skin pink<br>
        fill me with seeds<br>
        and pray for my faux womb<br>
        the empty space above my abdomen<br>
        so, maybe one day I’ll be<br>
        a mother too<br>
        <br>
        *<br>
        <br>
        the future is a vicious woman<br>
        our world – already post apocalypse<br>
        the blood once rushing to my head<br>
        now spilling down my wrists.<br>
        I want her to taste my<br>
        warm thick blood<br>
        and spare my sisters<br>
        from reliving<br>
        that pain<br>
        I know my place<br>
        I am the matriarch<br>
        birthing a new world<br>
        in my death<br>

            I read the poetic prompts Lucy and Alessia sent and I was really attracted to these:<br>
            5. A poem with each word deconstructed<br>
            8. A recording of the first embrace that knits back together the world<br>
            9. A recording of the last border broken<br>
            17. A poem for the future possibilities of decolonial love<br>
            19. Consciously deconstruct and consume a fruit of your choice, using only your bare hands<br>
            I think my favourite one is the last one! Would love to know which ones were your favourite<br>
            prompts so we could start thinking about which theme we like collectively!

I still like what we discussed about this project being messy, so I imagine the editing to be quite minimal and clean, and I kind of want to keep the raw footage as much as possible.
