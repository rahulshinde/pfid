                POEMS FOR IMPENDING DOOM began as a semi-clear concept: <em>the world is pretty fucked right now - let's write some poems about how we would do it if we could do it all again.</em> 
                <br>
                <br>
                Our conceptual prompts were poetic in nature; ones that asked what the world would look like without well-established concepts like borders and institutions; things that are currently under fire in most arts and critical publications and media. We also considered the idea that our future(s) would require more rebuilding than dismantling. 
                <br>
                <br>
                To supplement the focus on world-building and preparing for our respective futures and futurisms, we asked four artists– Arielle Twist, Camila Salcedo, Camille Rojas, and Madeleine Scott– to create art in pairs, whatever that meant to them and their practices. They (Arielle & Camila, Maddy & Camille) also documented their processes of collaboration and making, as a way to root the finished works in a history of their own. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This original concept quickly spidered outward and inward after speaking with the artists about their ideas surrounding the framework. They had different perspectives about what it means to start over, and how productive it is to completely rebuild and reimagine without stopping to first take stock of what has occurred in the past. An obstacle became clear: What is re-imagining? What if we need to re-imagine the way we think about imagining. What does this “re” suggest for those of us that have been “re”-moved from the canon, “re”-stricted from aesthetic optimism, “re”-strained from claiming rightful “re”-cognition? In this sense, to re-imagine a future is to further other. It is to suggest there was no past, no deep and richly crafted ancestral lineage that led to this moment. It is the opposite of assertion; an acceptance of the erasure of colonial history. Following this, we no longer felt the need to hold onto the same notions of rebuilding that we first considered.
                <br>
                <br>
                The impending doom feels real when a path to some kind of serenity begins with writing a love letter to the place you were born and calling it homeland, as if suggesting a distance from it. Realizing that some of us are lucky enough to know our homelands in a sweet way, without crying for them, while some of us think about homeland with both the “then” and “now”; and oftentimes the “now” is a fearful and contentious and uncertain place. 
                <br>
                <br>
                To rise it seems integral to root. Whether that means cultivating love, a home, or drawing on the strength and knowledge of predecessors; all of the works that were created are in a way, totally rooted in the past. This makes sense, since the healing has to come from somewhere. It’s clear that in order to build a future we need a foundation to refer back to. We cannot rebuild as if history has not lead us to where we currently situate. So we write poems, we express love, we respect the past and honour those who came before us. We even arm ourselves with our precious histories, so that we may dance wildly into the jaws of the future; confront the precarity of technology and information, the toxic force of egos, the disease of apathy. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We build on the worlds that have been constantly built on and on and on because of (past) care and (past) love and (past) survival and (past) trauma and (ongoing) healing.

            the way i get to travel to my roots<br>
            fruitful from the motherland<br>
            rooted but afloat; out here we bloom<br>
            i remember<br>
            the pinch and peel of a mamón<br>
            the feel of the hard jelly yet citrus kiss<br>
            the gooey drop encased between my two fingers<br>
            then travelled into my mouth perfectly fitting in between my lips<br>
            i remember<br>
            mangos which i ate straight from the tree<br>
            they can never be replicated by the<br>
            grocery-store-bought-in-the-middle-of-winter “man-goes”<br>
            the juice dripping down my fingers, barely any fibers,<br>
            pit perfectly fit the size of my mouth,<br>
            perfectly hand held as a merienda when we were locked out of the house<br>
            i remember<br>
            guayabas<br>
            sometimes came wrapped in little plastic sweet like candy; dulces<br>
            empalagante to the palate<br>
            so pink and soft like my cheeks when i am flustered,<br>
            yet citric with little pits that excited my teeth and tastebuds at every little bite<br>
            i remember<br>
            nísperos the rough outside like dry skin on your elbows,<br>
            it cuts so softly and with a spoon i’d scoop out the insides, so sweet,<br>
            some one-or-two seeds, in between, i’d take them out they were so clean<br>
            and i loved it on any time of the day, i could eat so many,<br>
            a sweetness i only remembered once i felt it again<br>
            far away from the motherland<br>
            i vaguely remember<br>
            parchitas<br>
            juice, pulp, acid, crunchy,<br>
            bitter on the outside but on the inside, feisty,<br>
            the man at the mercado shook it like a maraca<br>
            guts travelled from edge to edge of its globular skin<br>
            announcing it was ready for consumption<br>
            but i could not remember how to eat it

                  I read the poetic prompts Lucy and Alessia sent and I was really attracted to these:<br>
                  5. A poem with each word deconstructed<br>
                  8. A recording of the first embrace that knits back together the world<br>
                  9. A recording of the last border broken<br>
                  17. A poem for the future possibilities of decolonial love<br>
                  19. Consciously deconstruct and consume a fruit of your choice, using only your bare hands<br>
                  I think my favourite one is the last one! Would love to know which ones were your favourite<br>
                  prompts so we could start thinking about which theme we like collectively!

                  I&#39;ve also been chatting with my sister about dates, I&#39;d like to film end of next week on Friday or Saturday with her, so I&#39;d have to source the fruits early next week and then the following week I am gone already so I would be able to do the editing of the video (whether we decide to do our individual videos or merge them somehow). I still like what we discussed about this project being messy, so I imagine the editing to be quite minimal and clean, and I kind of want to keep the raw footage as much as possible.

                  I&#39;ve also been chatting with my sister about dates, I&#39;d like to film end of next week on Friday or Saturday with her, so I&#39;d have to source the fruits early next week and then the following week I am gone already so I would be able to do the editing of the video (whether we decide to do our individual videos or merge them somehow). I still like what we discussed about this project being messy, so I imagine the editing to be quite minimal and clean, and I kind of want to keep the raw footage as much as possible.

            my womanhood is rebuilt in the setting sun<br>
            my vagina theoretical, womb swollen in my throat<br>
            birthing stories that claw their way through thin tissue.<br>
            <br>
            I spit blood with each poem,<br>
            I birth myself with each bite.<br>
            <br>
            *<br>
            <br>
            blood and berries, unconscious lust<br>
            for the sweet, the savage<br>
            stain my red skin pink<br>
            fill me with seeds<br>
            and pray for my faux womb<br>
            the empty space above my abdomen<br>
            so, maybe one day I’ll be<br>
            a mother too<br>
            <br>
            *<br>
            <br>
            the future is a vicious woman<br>
            our world – already post apocalypse<br>
            the blood once rushing to my head<br>
            now spilling down my wrists.<br>
            I want her to taste my<br>
            warm thick blood<br>
            and spare my sisters<br>
            from reliving<br>
            that pain<br>
            I know my place<br>
            I am the matriarch<br>
            birthing a new world<br>
            in my death<br>
